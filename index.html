        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>I have a diverse professional background, having worked across various consultancy sectors such as Gas/Electricity, banks, and supplies, primarily as a programmer or programmer analyst in Java projects.
			My journey began with a scholarship in China at the education office of the Embassy of Spain. Following its completion, I pursued a Master's degree in Oviedo, where I concurrently worked as a Junior Consultant at Capgemini. This marked the beginning of my professional career.</p>

		<p>An exciting opportunity led me to Madrid, where I contributed to an international project for Santander Bank. In this dynamic role, I provided support to multiple countries and directly collaborated with users in Milton Keynes, UK. Subsequently, I seized the chance to work in Switzerland at CERN, facilitated by CIEMAT (Centre for Energy, Environment, and Technology). I engaged in a project involving the deployment of applications within Docker and deploying in OpenShift and Kubernetes, overseeing the computing infrastructure and tools essential for the group's operations.</p>

		<p>During my five years at CERN, where I collaborated directly with CERN's IT department, I contributed to projects like MALT. This involved exploring alternatives to replace SharePoint with other similar applications. Now, with a wealth of experience, I am actively seeking new opportunities to further develop and expand my expertise as a DevOps Engineer.</p>

		<p>Currently, I am serving as a Software Engineer at Aeschabch 1904, where I am deeply involved in a middleware project utilizing Java and Mule. In this role, I am instrumental in developing and supporting a sophisticated software intermediary that seamlessly connects various functions across Android devices, e-commerce, financial systems, and a quality application.</p>

		<p>The primary objective is to facilitate the efficient exchange of information, and I am actively engaged in the development and support of this middleware project. The integration spans multiple databases, including Oracle and MySQL, where I play a crucial role in both retrieving and updating information. This dynamic environment has allowed me to further hone my skills in Java and Mule, contributing to the success of the middleware project and ensuring the smooth operation of diverse functionalities across different platforms.</p>
